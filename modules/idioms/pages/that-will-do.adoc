= that will do

used to order sb to stop doing or saying sth

- *That'll do*, children â€” you're getting far too noisy.
- That *will do*, young man: one more word out of you and you're grounded!
- "Do you need more potatoes peeled?" "No, *that'll do*, thanks."
- *That will do*, Charles. I don't want to see any more of that kind of behaviour.
