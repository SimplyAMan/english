== Possibility

We use *may*, *might* and *could* to say that something is possible, but not certain:

* They may come by car. (= Maybe they will come by car.)
* They might be at home. (= Maybe they are at home.)
* If we don't hurry, we could be late. (= Maybe we will be late.)

We use *can* to make general statements about what is possible:

* It can be very cold here in winter. (= It is sometimes very cold here in winter.)
* You can easily get lost in this town. (= People often get lost in this town.)
* Drinks in restaurants *can* be very expensive. (= Drinks are sometimes expensive.)

We use *could* to make general statements about the past:

It *could* be very cold there in winter. (= It was sometimes very cold there in winter.)
You *could* easily get lost in that town. (= People often got lost in that town.)

We *do not* use can to talk about specific events:

* Where's John?
* I'm not sure. He *may/might/could be* (NOT can) in his office.

Difference in meaning between *can* and *may/might/could*:

* That dog *can be* dangerous. (= Sometimes that dog is dangerous. I know.)

* That dog *may/might/could be* dangerous. (= Perhaps that dog is dangerous. I don't know.)

We use *may have, might have or could have* to *make guesses about the past*:

* I haven't received your letter. It *may have got lost* in the post.
* It's ten o'clock. They *might have arrived* by now.
* Where are they? They *could have got lost*.

== Impossibility

We use *can't* or *cannot* to say that something is impossible:

* That *can't* be true.
* You *cannot* be serious.

We use *can't have* or *couldn't have* to say that a past event was impossible:

* They know the way here. They *can't have got* lost!
* If Jones was at work until six, he *couldn't have done* the murder.

== Certainty

We use *must* to show we *are sure* something is true and we *have reasons* for our belief:

* It's getting dark. It *must* be quite late.
* You havenâ€™t eaten all day. You *must* be hungry.

We use *should* to *suggest* something is true and we *have reasons* for our suggestion:

* Ask Miranda. She *should* know.
* It's nearly six o'clock. They *should* arrive soon.

We use *must have* and *should have* for the past:

* They hadn't eaten all day. They *must have been* hungry.
* You look happy. You *must have heard* the good news.
* It's nearly eleven o'clock. They *should have arrived* by now.
