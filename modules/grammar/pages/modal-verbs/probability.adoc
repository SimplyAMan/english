We can use these modal verbs (also called modals of deduction, speculation or certainty) when we want to make a guess about something. We choose the verb depending on how sure we are.

== Present

=== must / might / could / may / can't + infinitive

I am waiting for Julie with another friend, David.
I ask: 'Where is Julie?'
David guesses:
* She *must* be on the bus. (I'm fairly sure this is a good guess)
* She *might* come soon. (maybe)
* She *could* be lost. (maybe)
* She *may* be in the wrong room. (maybe)
* She *can't* be at home. (I'm fairly sure this isn't true)

We use *may*, *might* and *could* to say that something is possible, but not certain:

* They *may* come by car. (= Maybe they will come by car.)
* They *might* be at home. (= Maybe they are at home.)
* If we don't hurry, we *could* be late. (= Maybe we will be late.)

We use *can't* or *cannot* to say that something is impossible:

* That *can't* be true.
* You *cannot* be serious.

We use *must* to show we *are sure* something is true and we *have reasons* for our belief:

* It's getting dark. It *must* be quite late.
* You havenâ€™t eaten all day. You *must* be hungry.

=== Will / won't

We use will and won't when we are very sure:

* She'll be at work now.

=== Should / shouldn't

*Should* and *shouldn't* are used to *make an assumption* about what is probably true, if everything is as we expect:

* They *should* be there by now.
* Ask Miranda. She *should* know.
* It's nearly six o'clock. They *should* arrive soon.
* It *shouldn't* take long to drive here.

This use of *should* isn't usually used for negative events. Instead, it's a better idea to use *will*:

* The underground *will* be very busy now (not: 'should be').

=== Can

*Can* is used for something that is generally possible, something we know sometimes happens:

* Prices *can* be high in London.
* *Can* is not used to talk about specific possibilities:
* He *could* be on the bus (not: 'can be').
* It *can* be very cold here in winter. (= It is sometimes very cold here in winter.)
* You *can* easily get lost in this town. (= People often get lost in this town.)
* Drinks in restaurants *can* be very expensive. (= Drinks are sometimes expensive.)

We *do not* use *can* to talk about specific events:

* Where's John?
* I'm not sure. He *may/might/could be* (NOT can) in his office.

Difference in meaning between *can* and *may/might/could*:

* That dog *can be* dangerous. (= Sometimes that dog is dangerous. I know.)

* That dog *may/might/could be* dangerous. (= Perhaps that dog is dangerous. I don't know.)


== Past

=== must / might / could / may / can't + have + past participle

We use *may have, might have or could have* to *make guesses about the past*:

* I haven't received your letter. It *may have got lost* in the post.
* It's ten o'clock. They *might have arrived* by now.
* Where are they? They *could have got lost*.
* They hadn't eaten all day. They *must have been* hungry.
* You look happy. You *must have heard* the good news.

We use *can't have* or *couldn't have* to say that a past event was impossible:

* They know the way here. They *can't have got* lost!
* If Jones was at work until six, he *couldn't have done* the murder.

You: Where was Julie last night?
David:
* She *must have forgotten* about our date.
* She *might have worked* late.
* She *could have taken* the wrong bus.
* She *may have felt* ill.
* She *can't have stayed* at home.

=== Will / won't + have + past participle

*Will* and *won't* / *will not + have + past participle* are used for *past certainty* (compare with present use of 'will' above):

* The parcel will have arrived before now.

=== Should + have + past participle

*Should + have + past participle* can be used to *make an assumption* about something that has probably happened, if everything is as we expect (compare with present use of 'should' above):

* The train should have left by now
* It's nearly eleven o'clock. They *should have arrived* by now.

=== Could

We can use *could + infinitive* to talk about a general possibility in the past (compare with the use of 'can' above):

* Prices *could* be high in the sixteenth century.
* It *could* be very cold there in winter. (= It was sometimes very cold there in winter.)
* You *could* easily get lost in that town. (= People often got lost in that town.)


This is not used to talk about specific possibilites in the past (instead we use *could + have + past participle*):

* He *could have been working* late (not: 'could be'. As this is a specific possiblity, 'could be' is present tense)
